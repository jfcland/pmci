    Pavement Maintenance Contractors, Inc. repairs pavement cracks and
    joints by evaluating the type and cause of cracks. When cracks are amenable to repair, important preparation that
    includes cleaning, drying, and shaping (routing) of cracks or
    joints is necessary to assure proper crack or joint filling.

    PMCI uses the highest grade, hot-applied liquid rubberized
    sealant. Our equipment includes a double jacket melter with a
    heated pressurized hose and wand.

    Repairs last the longest by minimizing water infusion into the
    cracks and thereby substantially increasing the lifetime of your
    pavement. It is estimated that crack and joint filling and
    sealing performed at 3-year intervals will more than double the
    lifetime of your pavement.

    Effective and inexpensive, crack filling and joint sealing is
    often the first step in preventative care of your pavement.
